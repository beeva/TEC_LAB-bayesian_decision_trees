# Bayesian Decision Trees

Exploration of the performance and interpretability of bayesian decision trees.

Bayesian Decision Trees are standard decision trees trained using bayesian methods. Their cognitive performance is higher than that of standard decision trees, and they have the same interpretability. They could be a good baseline in Data Science projects.
